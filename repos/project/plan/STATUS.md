# repos — Plan Status

This is the manifest: one line per **pending** phase in build order, and the
**only** place a phase's `⬜` marker lives. Each phase line is a Markdown
bullet beginning with `- Phase`, carrying `⬜` (pending). The build loop finds
its next work with `grep -nE '^- Phase .* ⬜' project/plan/STATUS.md | head -1`
and reads only that phase's `project/plan/phase-NN.md`. On completion the
build loop **deletes** the phase's line and its body file — there is no done
marker; done is gone. This file deliberately carries **no bare status glyph**
outside the phase lines, so the anchored grep matches only phase lines.

Next phase: 24

- Phase 23 ⬜ realizes D14 — prove the adopted suite contracts (`R-4LKF-FB23`, `R-8DF1-W89F`, `R-8IAN-FB87`) at the composition root in `cmd/repos/main_test.go`
