# dashboard — Plan Status (web surface & sign-in)

This is the **manifest**: one line per **pending** phase in build order, and the
**only** place a phase's `⬜` marker lives. Each phase line is a Markdown bullet
beginning `- Phase` and carrying `⬜` (pending). The build loop finds its next
unit of work with `grep -nE '^- Phase .* ⬜' project/plan/STATUS.md | head -1`,
reads only that phase's `project/plan/phase-NN.md`, and builds it. On completion
the build loop **deletes** that phase's line here and its `phase-NN.md` body
file — there is no done marker; done is gone. This file deliberately carries
**no bare status glyph** anywhere but on a phase line, so the anchored grep
matches only phase lines.

Next phase: 49

- Phase 48 ⬜ realizes R-6MX7-JDFX — raise the apex fragment's `variables_hash_max_size` to the box-verified 4096 (2048 proved insufficient on the box's nginx build) and retarget its file-content test
